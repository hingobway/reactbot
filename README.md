# reactbot

A Discord Bot for automated phrase reactions and similar reaction antics.

## Usage

1. Invite the bot to as many servers as you wish.
1. The bot will react to every message sent with an emoji or set of emojis set by you.
1. (anyone can) Change that emoji set using `;sete [a string of emojis with spaces in between]`.
1. (those who have been whitelisted can) use `;kille` to stop all reactions until the bot is restarted.
